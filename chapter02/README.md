# Slackbot Trader Example, #02

This is the second part of a tutorial on how I built Slackbot Trader for [Alpaca API](https://docs.alpaca.markets).

## Spec

- Adds additional features to `/order`, such as `/list` and `/clear`

## How to run it

If you have pip, install the requirements.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

It is a simple Flask application server.

```sh
$ python tradebot.py
```

If you are running this in localhost, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [serveo](http://serveo.net/) to expose as public URL.
