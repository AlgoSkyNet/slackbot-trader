# Slackbot Trader Example, #01

This is the first tutorial of how I built Slackbot Trader for [Alpaca API](https://docs.alpaca.markets).

## Spec

- Written in Python
- Handles a slash command `/order`
- Submits a market order for my account with specified symbol and quantity

## How to run it

If you have pip, install the requirements.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

It is a simple Flask application server.

```sh
$ python tradebot.py
```

If you are running this in localhost, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [serveo](http://serveo.net/) to expose as public URL.
