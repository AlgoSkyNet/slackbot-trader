# Slackbot Trader Example, #03

This is the third and final part of a tutorial on how I built Slackbot Trader for [Alpaca API](https://docs.alpaca.markets).

## Spec

- Adds streaming capabilities with new commands such as `/subscribe_streaming` and `/unsubscribe_streaming`

## How to run it

If you have pip, install the requirements.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

It is a simple Flask application server.

```sh
$ python tradebot.py
```

If you are running this in localhost, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [serveo](http://serveo.net/) to expose as public URL.
